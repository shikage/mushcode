# MUSHCode
A repository for storing and origanizing my MUSHCode projects.

These projects are built to be used on RhostMUSH servers and may not work
as intended on other code bases.

## SpaceGen - ShiKage's Space Generation
This is a set of object with code to support the automatic generation of star systems
using rules based on those presented in Traveller 5. This is to allow procedural generation
of a large number of star systems for a space game that follows rules similar to the 
Traveller system.
